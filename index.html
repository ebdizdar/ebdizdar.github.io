        <p>Prior to the 17th century, the first corporations were created in Europe as not-for-profit entities to build institutions, such as hospitals and universities, for the public good. They had constitutions detailing their duties overseen by the government. Straying outside these was punishable by law.</p>

      <ul>
          <li><strong>Company: </strong>A company is any entity that engages in business and can be a proprietorship, partnership or corporation.</li>
          <li><strong>Sole Proprietorships: </strong>Sole proprietorships and general partnerships are the most common forms of business structure and are the easiest to set up. A sole proprietorship is a business comprised of one individual and is not considered a formal organization. Legally, this type of business does not exist separately from its owner.</li>
          <li><strong>General Partnerships: </strong>A general partnership is similar in structure to a sole proprietorship except that this structure involves two or more people. Each partner pays his or her own taxes separately, using his own social security or tax ID number, but the company does not exist as a separate entity. Therefore, the financial resources of the business partners could be at risk in the event of a lawsuit.</li>
          <li><strong>Corporations as a Separate Legal Entity: </strong>A corporation is a business entity that legally exists separately from its owner(s). The owners of a corporation are shareholders; their percentage of ownership in the business is represented by their corporate stocks or shares. Shareholders can choose a board of directors to manage business operations, or they can create a shareholders' agreement, which will allow them to manage the business directly. Corporations are more complex than unincorporated businesses. You will need to file the taxes for the corporation separately from your personal taxes. In most states, you will not be held personally responsible for corporate debts.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited Liability Company: </strong>A limited liability company is neither a partnership nor a corporation, but it has some characteristics of both. The owners are able to participate in business decisions, as in a partnership, but an LLC offers some protection of the individual assets of its owners. The flexibility of the LLC has made it a popular choice among business owners.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited Partnerships of Two or More People: </strong>A limited partnership is made up of two or more persons, including at least one general partner and one limited partner. Details of this structure may vary from state to state. Business affairs of a limited partnership are conducted according to a partnership agreement created by the partners.</li>
